**_Wave shooter_** (didn't come up with a name yet!) is a game where you defeat waves of angry enemies, get upgrades and try to survive as long as you possibly can. The enemies get **stronger and stronger** each wave and you must adapt!

Currently, there are three enemies - a **big one**, a small, **aggressive** one, and _a cyan one with a shotgun._
You can choose an upgrade at the end of each wave. Some of the upgrades are: _more health, faster player speed_, or a **machine gun**!
